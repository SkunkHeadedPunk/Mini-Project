This file contains instructions from Jack for using git on the command line on Jack's SD card in the Raspberry Pi.
Git is how you should use GitHub repositories on Raspberry Pi. It's different than on PC.
I've put this here to save you a little time in Google, although this stuff is not too difficult to find. I have it written down myself, for reference anyways.
Notes are contained in brackets - [ ]
If you put all these lines in the command line in order, you will successfully update the shared repository.
If you are updating more than one file at a time... I haven't personally tried that yet. Either google it, or just try one at a time?




[GET TO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY / local repository; this file path is different if you're on a different system, depending on where you put it]
[I know there is one Pi somewhere where the project directory is accessed at...    cd ~/seed/Mini-Project"]

cd ~/Mini-Project




[PULL any changes to the repository]

git pull origin




[ADD / UPDATE a file you've changed in the repository; this is how you select what you're going to commit to the repository]

git add filename.extension




[COMMIT your changes to the GitHub repository or something]
[Make sure you add a comment, because I don't know what to do with the next screen if you done. Also it's good practice or something.]

git commit -m "add your comment here in the quotation marks"




[PUSH your commit to the shared repository]

git push origin
